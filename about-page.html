    <h2>Welcome to the about page of Thomas & Friends (T&F) History.</h2>
    <h3>The Purpose of The Site</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this site will be to inform new fans of the “Thomas & Friends” franchise and give them information on seasons and books as well as the creator and others who helped the franchise expand.</p>
    <h3>>What The Site Should Accomplish</h3>
    <p>What this website should accomplish is to spread word about the history of the franchise to newer fans. That would consider this site as a non-profit to spread free information.</p>
    <h3>Who The Intended Audience Is</h3>
    <p>The website will be mainly aimed towards newer fans of the “Thomas & Friends” franchise. This is so that they can have an option of researching the franchise and learn the history of it if they are new to the franchise, but older fans are also welcome to view the website as well.</p>
    <h3>The Opportunity Being Addressed</h3>
    <p>The opportunity being addressed is giving information to the public. Many newer fans of the franchise are probably children around the ages of three to seven. Children at that age would have seen seasons 22 through 24 which were not as good as the previous 21 seasons and are also a far cry from the first 7 seasons, which was known as the classic series era.</p>
    <h3>The Content That Will be Displayed on the Site</h3>
    <p>The content that will be displayed on the site will surround every season of the franchise including the episodes, movies, music, props, creator(s), narrator(s), and sets. Other information related to those topics will be displayed as well.</p>
